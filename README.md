# Pluginizer

Personal rails plugin generator with preferred settings/files (it sets my github noreply email, name, etc.).

## Installation

Install the gem:

    $ gem install pluginizer

To output the current gem version:

    $ pluginizer -v

## Usage

    $ pluginizer my-new-plugin-name

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
